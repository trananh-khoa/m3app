# martello murder mystery application

We created a tool where the user can pick a certain suspect and see all of the events related to them. The user can select a certain event, this will map the suspects location on to the floor plan and will also map all other suspects location at the event time that the user selected. We also implemented a raw data table which is filterable by all fields and is sortable.
